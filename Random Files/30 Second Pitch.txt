30 Second Pitch
----------------
1) What does your company do?
A) At Help, we allow people to order services like lawn mowing and babysitting from 
businesses that offer those kinds of services.

2) How big is the market for your company?
A) In the United States, service-producing businesses account for roughly 70% of the GDP,
giving us about 539 billion dollars worth of business activity per year. Globally, that
same math gives us a global market of almost 3 trillion dollars per year.

3) How much traction do you have?
A) I came up with the idea in February, had a beta ready by April, and launched the app
in June.
